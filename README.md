# Project Description:
The Title of our project is Exam Spot Guide. This website provides the information about various Computer Based Test (CBT) Examination Centres across Hyderabad.

They will not have any proper guidance about how to reach the centre from Bus Station or Railway Stations of Hyderabad where they are alighted.

Just when the user need to view the information about any exam centre, they just need to search by its name and they can also go to the exam centre Section of the home page and click on view details button.
