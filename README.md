# Project Description:
The Title of our project is Exam Spot Guide. This website provides the information about various Computer Based Test (CBT) Examination Centres across Hyderabad. As many Entrance exams and Competitive exams will be conducted in CBT mode, Many people from many villages of Telangana and neighbour states like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka comes to Hyderabad for attending for those examinations. They will not have any proper guidance about how to reach the centre from Bus Station or Railway Stations of Hyderabad where they are alighted. They may faces some problems while searching their examination centres. To help them in such situations we have made this website, which contains the information of Bus Routes, and some other additional details about the examination centre. The additional details contains some information about various facilities provided in the examination centre and exact location of the exam centre. We have also added the link of Google maps location for each exam centre so that the user can navigate to the exam centre by Google Maps.
	Our website UI design is user friendly UI Design, we have placed many elements which helps the user to search their exam centre easily and also we have mentioned some exam centres in the home page itself to make user to view the details of the centre in simple steps. We have also made a responsive design, so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size on which it is viewed. It keeps images from being larger than the screen width, and prevents visitors on mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read your content. Working of our website is very simple. Just when the user need to view the information about any exam centre, they just need to search by its name and they can also go to the exam centre Section of the home page and click on view details button. If they cannot find his exam centre on that section, simply they can click on the more centres button, and then it takes them to the page where they can find the list of the entire available exam centres list. Once they click on View details button, it takes them to the page, where they can find the details about that particular exam centres. That page includes all the essential information related to the centre along with the various facilities provided by that exam centre.
